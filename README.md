Chat Application Frontend

# DESCRIPTION : This is the frontend part of my WhatsApp-style messaging application built for the Relatim technical challenge. What started as a basic messaging app requirement turned into a pretty comprehensive chat platform with lots of cool features.

# What I Built

This is a modern real-time chat application that feels familiar (think WhatsApp/Telegram) but with some extra bells and whistles. The core requirement was to have a sidebar with Chat and Contacts tabs, plus a top navigation - but I ended up building way more than that.

# Tech Stack

Core Framework:

React 18 - Obviously needed this for the MERN requirement.
Vite - Way faster than Create React App, and the hot reload is lightning quick during development

State Management:

Redux Toolkit - The requirements didn't specify this, but managing chat state, user auth, and real-time updates across components would be messy with just React state
RTK Query - Actually, I built custom API layers instead, but the pattern is similar.

Real-time Communication:

Socket.io Client - Had to make this feel like a real chat app, so messages appear instantly without refreshing.

Styling & UI:

Tailwind CSS - I can style components super fast with this, and the utility classes keep everything consistent
Framer Motion - Added smooth animations because modern apps just feel better with micro-interactions
Lucide React - Clean, consistent icons throughout the app

# Authentication:

Google OAuth - Beyond the basic login, I added social auth because that's what users expect these days

Form Handling:

React Hook Form - Makes form validation and error handling much cleaner than manual state management

File Handling:

React Dropzone - For drag-and-drop file uploads (images, documents, etc.)

Additional Utilities:

date-fns - Much lighter than moment.js for handling message timestamps
React Hot Toast - Better than browser alerts for user feedback
Emoji Picker React - Because what's a chat app without emojis? ðŸ˜„

# Features Implemented

Required Features âœ…

Left Sidebar: Clean tabbed interface switching between Chats and Contacts

# Architecture Decisions

Why Redux Toolkit?
Chat applications have complex state that needs to be shared across many components - active chats, message history, user status, notifications. Redux makes this manageable and predictable.

Component Structure:
I organized components by feature rather than type. So all chat-related components live together, making it easier to find what you need when working on chat features.

Real-time Strategy:
Socket.io handles all real-time features. The frontend listens for events and updates the Redux store, which automatically updates all connected components.

Mobile-First Design:
Built responsive from the ground up. The sidebar becomes a modal on mobile, and touch interactions work smoothly.

Performance Considerations:
Message virtualization for long chat histories (hooks prepared)
Image compression before upload
Debounced search to avoid API spam
Optimistic updates for better perceived performance
